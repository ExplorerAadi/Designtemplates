				From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
				Website builders are tools that typically allow the construction of websites without manual code editing. They fall into two categories:

				online proprietary tools provided by web hosting companies. These are typically intended for users to build their private site. Some companies allow the site owner to install alternative tools (commercial or open source) â€” the more complex of these may also be described as Content Management Systems;
				offline software which runs on a computer, creating pages and which can then publish these pages on any host. (These are often considered to be "website design software", rather than "website builders".)

				History
				The first websites were created in the early 1990s.[1] These sites were manually written in HTML.

				Over time, software was created to help design web pages and by 1998 Dreamweaver had been established as the industry leader; however, some have criticized the quality of the code produced by such software as being overblown and reliant on tables. As the industry moved towards W3C standards, Dreamweaver and others were criticized for not being compliant. Compliance has improved over time, but many professionals still prefer to write optimized markup by hand.
