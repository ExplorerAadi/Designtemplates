		 <p class="para"><span class="boldd">Mechanical Engineering (ME)</span>requires good understanding of core concepts such as mechanics, kinematics, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics and energy. Engineers who study this discipline, use these core principles to design and analyze motor vehicles, aircrafts, heating & cooling systems, manufacturing plants, industrial equipment & machinery, robotics, medical devices among other things. 
		Mechanical Engineers play an important role in other industries that are non-mechanical, for instance, chemical, textile, electrical power,petrochemical, oil & fertilizer. 
		Therefore, there is increasing demand for Mechanical Engineers in the industry. The department aims to provide a student-centric learning environment that emphasizes on faculty-student interaction and practical education.</p>
