					<h2>What makes Codecademy Pro Intensive different?</h2>
					<p>“Being able to design with the end-user in mind is one of the most important skills you can have in the tech industry. Gone are the days of learning to code by making sites that say ‘Hello world!’ or that showcase filler content! Learn to make sites that will reach and move your audience from the very beginning.”</p>
